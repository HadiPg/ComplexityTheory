strongly biconnected directed graph G=(V,E) is 2-vertex strongly biconnected[5] if G has at least three
vertices and G\{w} is strongly biconnected for all vertices w in G.
Task
Step 1 An implementation of the Cheriyan-Mehlhorn-Gabow algorithm[1,2,3] for finding strongly connected components of a directed graph in linear time.
Step 2 An implementation of Jens Schmidt's algorihm[4] for testing whether an undirected graph is 2-connected(That means it has no articulation points) in linear time
Step3 Testing whether a directed graph is 2-vertex strongly biconnected or not
in time O(n(n+m)).
